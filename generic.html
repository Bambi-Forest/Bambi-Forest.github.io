						<p>Nage Murphy is a Junior Data Analyst, with experience collecting data, cleaning the data, merging everything together, following up with the "client", and not getting bogged down in the details. Her background in healthcare of 5 years as a Clinical Laboratory Scientist enhances her ability in time management, strong decision-making skills, patience and learning quickly. Nage is fueled by her passion for understanding data to get a result that drives an informed decision. She considers herself a ‘forever student’ eager to both build on her experience as a new junior data analyst and stay in tune with the latest data analytic technologies through continued coursework. </p>
